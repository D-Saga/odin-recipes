                <h2>What is arroz caldo?</h2>
                <p>Arroz Caldo or aroskaldo is a Filipino lugaw made of chicken and rice and flavored with fresh ginger, garlic, onions, and fish sauce. Although its name is derived from the Spanish arroz caldoso, which means “brothy rice,” the rice gruel is more of a local adaptation of the congee introduced in the Philippines by Chinese immigrants.</p>
                <p>The thick, hearty porridge is usually served in individual bowls with various toppings and condiments such as hard-boiled egg, chopped scallions, toasted garlic, and calamansi. It’s especially popular for breakfast, but it’s also commonly enjoyed as a midday snack or light dinner meal.</p>

                    <li>In a pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add onions, ginger and garlic. Cook, stirring regularly, until softened and aromatic.</li>

                    <li>Add rice and cook, stirring regularly, for about 1 to 2 minutes or until rice starts to lightly brown.</li>
